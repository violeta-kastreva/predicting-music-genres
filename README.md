# Machine Learning for Song Genre Classification
### Project Overview
This project focuses on the classification of song genres based on lyrics using various machine learning models. It demonstrates the process of preprocessing text data, feature extraction, and applying different algorithms to predict the genre of a song. The genres analysed are pop, rock and rap.

### Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization for converting song lyrics into numerical form. <br />
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest. 
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses accuracy, macro avg, and weighted avg to evaluate model performance.
- **Genre Analysis**: Offers insights into the most distinctive features of each genre through feature selection techniques.
